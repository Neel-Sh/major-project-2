				<h2>Introduction: Power Behind Every Comment</h2>
				<p class="lead">All students know the anxiety of waiting for feedback. What we often overlook is how that feedback—positive or negative—shapes identity long after grades fade. Words in red ink can damage confidence; patience and encouragement can transform how a student feels about language.</p>
				<p>Across classroom accounts and research closely studying long‑term effects, one conclusion stands out: feedback isn’t just about correction, it’s about connection. Thoughtful, process‑based feedback nurtures motivation and identity; harsh, vague, or dismissive comments leave lasting harm beyond grammar.</p>

				<h2>Red‑Ink Rejection</h2>
				<p>For L.S., a USF student and classmate, feedback once meant failure. In her account, <em>Graded in Red</em>, she recalls the shock of a bright red “C” on her first college‑level essay after hours of revision and second‑guessing every line. “The doubt seeped into [me] like the red ink did at the top of the page,” she wrote.</p>
				<p>What was intended as evaluation became humiliation. Even when she later earned a passing grade, the success didn’t feel like hers—more like a borrowed win thanks to her father’s help. This mirrors Sherma’s (2025) research showing that corrective marks and vague critiques can demotivate, heighten self‑doubt, and reduce curiosity when not accompanied by specific guidance.</p>
				<p>Similarly, Truax (2018) finds that “correcting, criticizing, and drawing attention to mistakes undermines writing motivation” when feedback lacks empathy and direction. L.S. needed guidance, not perfection—human, progressive feedback that builds clarity instead of fear.</p>

				<h2>Feedback vs. Silencing Identity</h2>
				<p>Feedback isn’t always a grade or red mark. Sometimes it’s a rule, a glance, or a sharp “SH!”. A bilingual classmate shared how a teacher’s reprimand during a casual conversation at a book fair turned pride in her native language into shame. The message was clear: her language didn’t belong. In that moment, “appropriate” classroom management became negative feedback that silenced identity.</p>
				<p>Sherma (2025) identifies this as a deep emotional impact of mismatched expectations: when teachers’ intentions and students’ needs diverge, students can feel pessimism and demoralization. What seems small to teachers can carry long‑lasting consequences about whose voices are worthy in academic spaces.</p>

				<h2>When Feedback Fosters Growth</h2>
				<p>Another classmate’s story shows the opposite: patient encouragement. Struggling with grammar and even holding a pencil, he met Ms. Taylor, who tutored him after class. “We would sit on a couch in the back of the classroom and read <em>Island of the Blue Dolphins</em>,” he remembers. “I began wanting to read the story.”</p>
				<p>Ms. Taylor’s feedback was gentle, specific, and human—focused on growth and enjoyment rather than catching every error. Truax (2018) calls this growth‑mindset feedback: specific, objective comments about students’ writing choices that highlight effort and persistence, reframing literacy as possibility rather than pressure.</p>
				<p>Zhu, Yang, and Yan (2024) add that scaffolding feedback boosts students by giving step‑by‑step cues, hints, and models so learners generate correct answers independently. That is precisely what Ms. Taylor did. By guiding—not dictating—she empowered her student to take ownership of learning. Reading became “a rewarding challenge,” a transformation made by caring feedback.</p>

        		<h2>Feedback as Power and Responsibility</h2>
				<p>Across these stories, a pattern emerges: feedback is power. It can reinforce insecurity, silence identity, or awaken confidence. Red ink marked failure; a reprimand marked exclusion; mentoring marked belonging. Each moment reshaped how a student saw themselves as a writer.</p>
				<p>Sherma cautions that learners do not improve until they perceive feedback as progressive and engage sincerely with it. Zhu et al. extend this insight: teacher feedback influences writing proficiency not only through direct correction but by shaping students’ self‑regulated learning beliefs. When teachers give feedback, they communicate value. “I see your effort,” or I don’t. The difference between correction and connection is the difference between shutting down a voice and helping it grow louder.</p>

				<h2>Conclusion: The Marks That Last</h2>
				<p>Feedback lingers in how students talk about their work, measure their worth, and see language as joy or fear. L.S.’s red ink, the silenced native tongue, and Ms. Taylor’s mentoring tell the same story from different angles: feedback can bruise, or it can build—discouraging or empowering.</p>
				<p>As Truax (2018) notes, comments like “I can tell you put a lot of effort into this writing piece” can help students develop a growth mindset. When feedback becomes connection, it builds not only stronger writers but stronger people. When it focuses only on correction, it risks convincing students their voices aren’t enough.</p>
