					<h2>Introduction: Power Behind Every Comment</h2>
					<p>It is a universal experience for all students to feel some sort of anxiety when it comes to waiting for returned feedback from our instructors. Whether on an exam, a paper, an assignment, or all three – we can't help but overthink our performance, all in hopes for acknowledgement of effort from our instructors. And what some fail to realize is that said feedback, whether positive or negative, can shape how we see ourselves as learners long after the grade is forgotten. Teacher feedback holds more power than it may seem. Words bolded in red-inked-pen damage confidence, while patience and encouragement from a tutor can change how a student feels about language entirely. Taking a look at student accounts and the work of researchers who closely study long term effects of classroom-related feedback all point to one conclusion: feedback isn't just about correction, it's about connection.</p>
					
					<p>When educators, tutors, and personnel alike provide thoughtful and process-based feedback, they nurture motivation and identity for students. In contrast, when comments are harsh, vague and dismissive, they leave a lasting impression that goes beyond a grammar check.</p>

					<h2>Red-Ink Rejection</h2>
					<p>For L.S. – a fellow USF student and classmate – feedback once meant failure. In her shared account, <em>Graded in Red</em>, she recalls feeling shocked in seeing a bright red "C" on her first college-level essay, after hours of revision and second-guessing of every line written on that paper.</p>
					
					<blockquote>"The doubt seeped into [me] like the red ink did at the top of the page."</blockquote>
					
					<p>What was meant as an evaluation of work, became a humiliation. Even after earning a passing grade later on, L.S. couldn't take pride in it as the success didn't feel like hers – but more of a borrowed win thanks to her father's help.</p>
					
					<p>This experience echoes Amar Sherma's (2025) research on teacher feedback and emotional wellbeing:</p>
					
					<blockquote>"Merely giving feedback may not be helpful if instructors neglect the psychology that is intrinsically associated with feedback…corrective feedback and scribbles on students' writings tend to discourage aspiring writers from realizing their full potential…"</blockquote>
					
					<p>The feedback L.S. received from her teacher – a big, red and vague 'C' – demonstrating just that. As Sherma explains, students feel "demotivated in the absence of specific or progressive feedback" (Sherma, 2025). What L.S. needed wasn't perfection but guidance. Instead, the feedback she received replaced her curiosity with fear and self-doubt.</p>
					
					<p>Similarly, Megan Truax (2018) found that "...correcting, criticizing, and drawing attention to mistakes undermines writing motivation…" (Truax, 2018). L.S.'s experience displaying how easily even well-intentioned critique can become destructive when it lacks both empathy and direction.</p>

					<h2>Feedback vs. Silencing Identity</h2>
					<p>Feedback doesn't always come as a grade or marked in red-ink. Sometimes it's a rule, a glance, or a simple "SH!".</p>
					
					<p>Another classmate wrote in her account her experiences growing up in a Spanish-speaking home, where her mother encouraged pride in their culture and language. That pride later tested during a book fair as she had a simple conversation with her friend in their native language. As her teacher overheard them and ordered them to stop, she asked for her reasoning behind the order, only to be scolded and punished.</p>
					
					<blockquote>"It made me realize how language could be turned against you."</blockquote>
					
					<p>What her teacher considered "appropriate" for classroom management, was actually a form of feedback – and negative at that. Translating to not only her, but the other students present of what language is considered 'acceptable' at school. A small and seemingly insignificant act, with now a life long consequence, implying that her (along other) native language(s) was unworthy of academic spaces.</p>
					
					<p>This moment reflects what Sherma (2025) identifies as a deep emotional impact of mismatched expectations between teachers and students:</p>
					
					<blockquote>"When teachers' feedback and students' expectations diverge significantly, it profoundly affects students' emotions, leading to feelings of pessimism and demoralization"</blockquote>
					
					<p>Sherma also argues that "feedback should be viewed as a sensitive, student-centered process requiring careful attention to learners' mental states, cultural backgrounds, and individual learning needs." (Sherma, 2025). The teacher's scolding ignored all of those dimensions, turning feedback into a subtle form of exclusion rather than growth.</p>
					
					<p>By contrast, Truax (2018) reminds us that "teachers' comments such as 'I can tell you put a lot of effort into this writing piece'… help students develop a growth mindset when it comes to writing" (Truax, 2018). That single line captures what was missing for this student: affirmation. Instead of acknowledging her bilingual ability as a strength, the teacher's "feedback" silenced her voice.</p>
					
					<p>The message was clear – her language didn't belong – and with it, she learned that the classroom could be a place of exclusions rather than empowerment.</p>

					<h2>When Feedback Fosters Growth</h2>
					<p>While Lucy's red marks and the bilingual student's silencing show the harm feedback can cause, another classmate's story demonstrates the opposite: the power of patient encouragement.</p>
					
					<p>In his account, the student recalls struggling with writing since childhood. Grammar confused him, spelling frustrated him, and even holding a pencil caused pain. It wasn't until a teacher named Ms. Taylor began tutoring him after class when things changed.</p>
					
					<blockquote>"We would sit on a couch in the back of the classroom and read 'Island of the Blue Dolphins.' I began wanting to read the story."</blockquote>
					
					<p>Ms. Taylor's feedback was gentle, specific, and human. Rather than correcting every error, she focused on growth and enjoyment.</p>
					
					<p>Her approach exemplifies what Truax (2018) calls 'growth mindset feedback':</p>
					
					<blockquote>"Specific, objective feedback about students' writing choices positively impacts writing motivation, whereas correcting, criticizing, and drawing attention to mistakes undermines it"</blockquote>
					
					<p>By highlighting effort and persistence, Ms. Taylor helped her student reframe literacy as possibility rather than pressure.</p>
					
					<p>Her method also reflects Zhu, Yang, and Yan's (2024) findings that "scaffolding feedback assists students in taking advantage of their writing process". They explain that "scaffolding feedback provides step-by-step cues, hints, and models to help students learn how to generate correct answers independently" (Zhu et al., 2024).</p>
					
					<p>That's exactly what Ms. Taylor did. By guiding, not dictating, she empowered her students to take ownership of learning. As he later wrote, reading became "a rewarding challenge" – a transformation only made possible through caring feedback.</p>

					<h2>Feedback as Power and Responsibility</h2>
					<p>Across these stories, one pattern emerges: feedback is power. It can reinforce insecurity, silence identity, or awaken confidence.</p>
					
					<p>Lucy's red pen marked failure; the bilingual student's reprimand marked exclusion; Ms. Taylor's patience marked belonging. Each moment of feedback reshaped how a student saw themselves as a writer.</p>
					
					<p>Sherma cautions that "learners do not improve their writing unless they perceive feedback as progressive or positive and engage sincerely with it" (Sherma, 2025). Zhu and others extend this idea, explaining that "teacher feedback influences writing proficiency not only through direct correction but also by shaping students' self-regulated learning beliefs" (Zhu et al., 2024).</p>
					
					<p>When teachers give feedback, they are not just grading – they are communicating value. Every word tells a student, 'I see your effort', or 'I don't'. The difference between correction and connection is the difference between shutting down a voice and helping it grow louder.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion: The Marks That Last</h2>
					<p>Feedback lives beyond the page. It lingers in how students talk about their work, how they measure their worth, and whether they see language as a source of joy or fear.</p>
					
					<p>L.S.'s red ink, the silenced native tongue, and Ms. Taylor's gentle mentorship all tell the same story from different angles: feedback can bruise, or it can build – empowering or discouraging oneself.</p>
					
					<p>Truax best puts it, saying that teachers' comments like "'I can tell you put a lot of effort into this writing piece,' or 'You tried all kinds of strategies to figure out the spelling of that word until you got it,' could help students to develop a growth mindset when it comes to writing." (Truax, 2018).</p>
					
					<p>When feedback becomes a connection, it builds not only stronger writers but stronger people. But when it focuses only on correction, it risks doing the opposite – leaving students convinced that their voices aren't enough.</p>

						<strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Feedback becomes transformative when it connects—guiding with care, specificity, and respect.
